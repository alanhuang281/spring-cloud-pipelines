check out the slides by https://twitter.com/ciberkleid[Cora Iberkleid] where she
migrates a setup of applications to be compliant with Spring Cloud Pipelines.

=== Introduction

This tutorial covers refactoring applications to comply with, and take advantage of, Spring Cloud Pipelines.

We will use a simple 3-tier application as an example:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/use_case_logical.png[title="Use Case - Logical View"]

At the end of this tutorial, it will be possible to instantly create a Concourse pipeline for each app and run successfully through a full lifecycle, from source code commit to production deployment, following the lifecycle stages for testing and deployment recommended by Spring Cloud Pipelines. The app code bases will be improved with organized test coverage, a contract-based API, and a versioned database schema, enabling Spring Cloud Pipelines to carry out stubbed testing and to ensure backward compatibility for API and database schema changes.

=== Sample application - initial state

The sample application is implemented using Spring Boot apps for the UI and service tiers, and MySQL for the database.

The apps are built using Maven and pushed manually to Cloud Foundry. They leverage the three Pivotal Spring Cloud Services: Config Server, Service Discovery, and Circuit Breaker Dashboard. Rabbit is used to propagate Config Server refresh triggers.

The source code for the two Spring Boot apps is stored on GitHub, as is the backing repo for Config Server.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/use_case_implementation.png[title="Use Case - Implementation"]

=== Sample application - end state

Through this tutorial, we will be adding Concourse and JFrog Bintray to manage the application lifecycle.

We will also be refactoring the application to comply with Spring Cloud Pipelines requirements and recommendations, including adding/organizing tests and introducing database versioning using Flyway and API contracts using Spring Cloud Contract.

=== Tutorial - overview

The migration steps are broken down into three stages:

. *Scaffolding*
- Minimal refactoring to comply with basic Spring Cloud Pipelines requirements.
- At the end of this stage, each app will have a corresponding pipeline on Concourse. The pipelines will successfully build the apps, store the artifacts in Bintray, tag the GitHub repositories, and deploy the apps to Test, Stage, and Prod spaces in Cloud Foundry.
. *Tests*
- Add/organize tests to comply with Spring Cloud Pipelines recommendations. Incorporate flyway for database schema versioning and initial data loading.
- At the end of this stage, the pipelines will trigger unit and integration tests during the Build stage, smoke tests in the Test environment, and end-to-end tests in the Stage environment. The pipelines will also ensure backward compatibility for the database, such that you can safely roll back the backend service app, even after the database schema has been updated.
. *Contracts*
- Incorporate Spring Cloud Contract to define the API between the UI and service apps and auto-generate tests and stubs.
- At the end of this stage, the pipelines will catch breaking API changes during the Build stage and ensure backward compatibility for the API, such that you can safely roll back the backend service (producer) app, even after an API change.

=== Tutorial - step-by-step

==== Prep: Before you begin

If you want to simply review the migration steps explained below, you can look at the various branches in the https://github.com/ciberkleid/greeting-ui[greeting-ui] and https://github.com/ciberkleid/fortune-service[fortune-service] repositories - there is a branch representing the end-state of each stage:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/github_branches.png[title="GitHub Branches"]

If you want to use this tutorial as a hands-on lab, fork each of the following repositories:

- https://github.com/ciberkleid/greeting-ui[greeting-ui]
- https://github.com/ciberkleid/fortune-service[fortune-service]
- https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[app-config]

Then, create a new directory on your local machine. You may name it anything you like; we will refer to it as `$SCP_HOME` throughout this tutorial.

In `$SCP_HOME`, clone your forks of `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`, as well as the following two repositories:

- https://github.com/spring-cloud-samples/cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot[cloudfoundry-stub-runner-boot]
- https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines[spring-cloud-pipelines]

Finally, create a directory called ``$SCP_HOME`/credentials`. Leave it empty for now.

==== Stage 1: Scaffolding

In this stage, we make minimal changes to satisfy basic Spring Cloud Pipelines requirements so that the apps can run through the entire pipeline without error. We make "scaffolding" changes only - no code changes.

The steps in this stage must be completed for both `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`.

===== 1.1 Create GitHub branches

```bash
git branch version
git checkout -b sc-pipelines
```
Branch *version* is required to exist, though it can be created as an empty branch. It is used by Spring Coud Pipelines to generate a version number for each new pipeline execution.

Branch *sc-pipelines* is optional and can be named anything you wish. The intention is for you to use it as a  working branch for the changes suggested in this tutorial (hence we create it and also check it out).

===== 1.2 Add Maven wrapper

```bash
mvn -N io.takari:maven:wrapper
```
This commands adds 4 files to a project:

[source,bash]
----
.
├── mvnw
├── mvnw.cmd
└── .mvn
    └── wrapper
        ├── maven-wrapper.jar
        └── maven-wrapper.properties
----

Make sure all four files are tracked by Git. For example, you can add the following to the `.gitignore` file:
```
#Exceptions
!/mvnw
!/mvnw.cmd
!/.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar
!/.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties
```

===== 1.3 Create Bintray maven repo package

We are using Bintray as the maven repository. Bintray requires that a package exist before any app artifacts can be uploaded.

Log into the Bintray UI and create the packages as follows.You can use the `Import from GitHub` option to create these:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/bintray_packages.png[title="Bintray Packages"]

===== 1.4 Configure distribution management using Bintray maven repo

Edit the app `pom.xml` files as follows. Make sure the Bintray URLs match the URLs of the corresponding packages created in the previous step. The values you use will be different from the example shown below.
```xml
<properties>
...
<distribution.management.release.id>bintray</distribution.management.release.id>
<distribution.management.release.url>https://api.bintray.com/maven/ciberkleid/maven-repo/fortune-service</distribution.management.release.url>
</properties>

...

<distributionManagement>
<repository>
<id>${distribution.management.release.id}</id>
<url>${distribution.management.release.url}</url>
</repository>
</distributionManagement>
```

Though not required by Spring Cloud Pipelines, it makes sense to also configure your local maven settings with the credentials to your Bintray maven repo. To do so, edit your maven settings file, usually `~/.m2/settings.xml`. If the file does not exist, create it.

Note that the `id` must match the id specified in the previous step. Also, make sure to use your username and API token (not account password) instead of the sample values shown below.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<settings>
  <servers>
    <server>
      <id>bintray</id>
      <username>ciberkleid</username>
      <password>my-super-secret-api-token</password>
   </server>
 </servers>
</settings>
```

===== 1.5 Push changes to GitHub

Push the above changes to GitHub. You should be pushing the following to each of the two app repos:

* 4 new maven wrapper files
* a modified .gitignore file
* a modified pom.xml

===== 1.6 Add Spring Cloud Pipelines credentials file
In `$SCP_HOME/credentials`, make two copies of the file `$SCP_HOME/spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse/credentials-sample-cf.yml`. Rename them as `credentials-fortune-service.yml` and `credentials-greeting-ui.yml`.

 Note: these files will contain credentials to you GitHub repo, your Bintray repo, and your Cloud Foundry foundation. Hence, we opt to put them in a separate directory. You may choose to store these files in a private git repo, but do not push them to a public repo.

Edit the git properties of each credentials file. Make sure to replace the sample values shown below as appropriate. For `tools-branch`, you may opt to use a fixed release (use v1.0.0.M8 or later for Cloud Foundry). Leave other values as they are, we will update those in later steps.
```yml
app-url: git@github.com:ciberkleid/fortune-service.git
app-branch: sc-pipelines
tools-scripts-url: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-pipelines.git
tools-branch: master
build-options: ""

github-private-key: |
  -----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
  MIIJKQIBAAKCAgEAvwkL97vBllOSE39Wa5ppczT1cr5Blmkhadfoa1Va2/IBVyvk

  ...
  -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
git-email: ciberkleid@pivotal.io
git-name: Cora Iberkleid
```

Edit the maven repo properties of each credentials file. Make sure to replace the sample values shown below as appropriate. Bintray requires separate URLs for uploads and downloads. If you are using a different artifact repository, such as Artifactory or Nexus, and the repository URL is the same for uploads and downloads, then you do not need to set `repo-with-binaries-for-upload`.
```yml
m2-settings-repo-id: bintray
m2-settings-repo-username: ciberkleid
m2-settings-repo-password: my-super-secret-api-token

repo-with-binaries: https://dl.bintray.com/ciberkleid/maven-repo

repo-with-binaries-for-upload: https://api.bintray.com/maven/ciberkleid/maven-repo/fortune-service
```
===== 1.7 Set Concourse pipeline

At this point, all of the build jobs, which run on Concourse workers, will succeed.

To verify this, log in to your Concourse target and set the Concourse pipelines. Update the target name in the example below as appropriate.

```bash
# Set greeting-ui pipeline
fly -t myTarget set-pipeline -p greeting-ui -c "${SCP_HOME}/spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse/pipeline.yml" -l "${SCP_HOME}/credentials/credentials-greeting-ui.yml" -n

# Set fortune-service pipeline
fly -t myTarget set-pipeline -p fortune-service -c "${SCP_HOME}/spring-cloud-pipelines/concourse/pipeline.yml" -l "${SCP_HOME}/credentials/credentials-fortune-service.yml" -n
```

Log into the Concourse UI and unpause the pipelines. Start each. You should see that the build jobs all succeed.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/concourse_build_success.png[title="Build Success"]

In addition, you will see a new dev/<version_number> tag in each GitHub repo, as well as the app jars uploaded into Bintray.

The test, stage, and prod jobs will fail because we have not yet added scaffolding for deployment to Cloud Foundry. We will do that next.

===== 1.8 Add Cloud Foundry manifest

If you are deploying to Cloud Foundry, you may already be routinely including manifest files with your apps. Our sample apps did not have manifest files, so we add them now.

In the `greeting-ui` repo, create a `manifest.yml` file as follows:
```yml
---
applications:
- name: greeting-ui
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
```

In the `fortune-service` repo, create a `manifest.yml` file as follows:
```yml
---
applications:
- name: fortune-service
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - fortune-db
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
```

The `TRUST_CERTS` variable is used by the Pivotal Spring Cloud Services (Config Server, Service Registry, and Circuit Breaker Dashboard), which we are using in this example. The value specified above assumes deployment to Pivotal Web Services. Update it accordingly if you are deploying to a different Cloud Foundry foundation, or you can leave it out altogether if you are replacing the Pivotal Spring Cloud Services with alternative implementations (e.g. deploying apps and exposing them as user-provided services).

You may add additional values to the manifest files if you wish, for example if additional values are useful for any manual deployment you may still want to do, or desirable in your Spring Cloud Pipelines deployment. For example, an alternative manifest.yml for 'fortune-ui` could be as follows:

```yml
---
applications:
- name: fortune-service
  timeout: 120
  instances: 3
  memory: 1024M
  buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git
  random-route: true
  path: ./target/fortune-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services:
  - fortune-db
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: someProfile
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
```

Note that `random-route` and `path` are ignored by Spring Cloud Pipelines. `instances` is honored in stage and prod, but overridden with a value of 1 for test.

===== 1.9 Add Spring Cloud Pipelines manifest

The Cloud Foundry manifest created in the previous step includes the logical names of the services to which the apps should be bound, but it does describe how the services can be provisioned. Hence, we add a second manifest file so that Spring Cloud Pipelines can provision the services.

Add a file called `sc-pipelines.yml` to each app, and include the same list of services as in the corresponding `manifest.yml`. Add the necessary details such that Spring Cloud Pipelines can construct a `cf create-service` command.

 Note: The `type: broker' parameter shown below instructs Spring Cloud Pipelines to provision a service using `cf create-service'. Other service types are also supported: cups, syslog, route, app, and stubrunner.

More specifically, for `greeting-ui`, create an `sc-pipelines.yml` file with the following content:

```yml
test:
  services:
    - name: config-server
      type: broker
      broker: p-config-server
      plan: standard
      params:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config
      useExisting: true
    - name: cloud-bus
      type: broker
      broker: cloudamqp
      plan: lemur
      useExisting: true
    - name: service-registry
      type: broker
      broker: p-service-registry
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
    - name: circuit-breaker-dashboard
      type: broker
      broker: p-circuit-breaker-dashboard
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
```

The `sc-pipelines.yml` file for `fortune-service` is similar, with the addition of the `fortune-db` service:
```yml
test:
  # list of required services
  services:
    - name: fortune-db
      type: broker
      broker: cleardb
      plan: spark
      useExisting: true
    - name: config-server
      type: broker
      broker: p-config-server
      plan: standard
      params:
        git:
          uri: https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config
      useExisting: true
    - name: cloud-bus
      type: broker
      broker: cloudamqp
      plan: lemur
      useExisting: true
    - name: service-registry
      type: broker
      broker: p-service-registry
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
    - name: circuit-breaker-dashboard
      type: broker
      broker: p-circuit-breaker-dashboard
      plan: standard
      useExisting: true
```

The values above assume deployment to Pivotal Web Services. If you are deploying to a different Cloud Foundry foundation, please update the values accordingly. Also, make sure to replace the `config-server` uri with the address of your fork of the https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[app-config] repo.

 Note the `useExisting: true` parameter above. By default, Spring Cloud Pipelines will delete and recreate services in the `test` space. To override this behavior and re-use existing services, we set `useExisting: true`.

===== 1.10 Push changes to GitHub

Push the above changes to GitHub. You should be pushing the following to each of the two app repos:

* new app manifest file
* new sc-pipelines manifest file

===== 1.11 Create Cloud Foundry Orgs/Spaces

Spring Cloud Pipelines requires that the Cloud Foundry test, stage, and prod spaces exist before a pipeline is run. If you wish, you can use different foundations, orgs, and users for each. For simplicity, in this example, we use a single foundation (PWS), a single org, and a single user.


You can name the org(s) and spaces anything you like. Each app requires its own test space. The stage and prod spaces are shared.

For this example, create the following spaces:
```bash
cf create-space scp-test-greeting-ui
cf create-space scp-test-fortune-service
cf create-space scp-stage
cf create-space scp-prod
```

===== 1.12 Create Cloud Foundry stage and prod service instances

Spring Cloud Pipelines will dynamically create the services in the test spaces as per the `sc-pipelines.yml` file we created previously. Optionally, a second section can be added to the `sc-pipelines.yml` file for the stage environment, and these will be created dynamically as well. Prod services, however, must always be created manually.

For this example, we will create the stage and services manually.

Create the services listed in the app manifest files in both `scp-stage` and `scp-prod`.

===== 1.13 Update Spring Cloud Pipelines credentials file
Update the `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service` credentials files with Cloud Foundry information. Replace values in the example below as appropriate for your Cloud Foundry environment.

Notice that the space name specified is a prefix. Spring Cloud Pipelines will append the app name, matching the test space names created previously. The stage and prod space names are not prefixes and will not be altered by Spring Cloud Pipelines.

Note also the `paas-hostname-uuid`. The value will be included in each route created. This value is optional, but it is useful in shared/multi-tenant environments such as PWS, as it helps ensure routes are unique. Change it to a unique uuid of your choosing.

```yml
pipeline-descriptor: sc-pipelines.yml

paas-type: cf

paas-hostname-uuid: cyi

# test values
paas-test-api-url: https://api.run.pivotal.io
paas-test-username: ciberkleid@pivotal.io
paas-test-password: secret
paas-test-org: S1Pdemo12
paas-test-space-prefix: scp-test

# stage values
paas-stage-api-url: https://api.run.pivotal.io
paas-stage-username: ciberkleid@pivotal.io
paas-stage-password: my-super-secret-password
paas-stage-org: S1Pdemo12
paas-stage-space: scp-stage

# prod values
paas-prod-api-url: https://api.run.pivotal.io
paas-prod-username: ciberkleid@pivotal.io
paas-prod-password: my-super-secret-password
paas-prod-org: S1Pdemo12
paas-prod-space: scp-prod
```

===== 1.14 Update Concourse pipeline with updated credentials files

Set the Concourse pipelines again, as we did previously, to update them with the values added to the credentials files. The test, stage, and prod jobs will all now succeed.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/concourse_test_stage_prod_success.png[title="Test, Stage, & Prod Success"]

On Cloud Foundry, you will now see the apps deployed in the test, stage, and prod spaces. The image below shows the deploymnet of `fortune-service` to its isolated and dedicated test space, with the 5 services declared in its manifest files (`sc-pipelines.yml` for provisioning, and `manifest.yml` for binding). It also shows the deployment of the same app to the shared prod space, including the stopped instance of the previous version. If a rollback were deemed necessary, the `prod-rollback` job in the pipeline could be triggered to remove the currently running version, remove the `prod/<version_number>` tag from GitHub, and re-start the former (*"venerable"*) version.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/cf_test_and_prod_deployed.png[title="Cloud Foundry Test and Prod Deployment"]

===== Stage 1 Recap

What have we accomplished?

* By adding the basic scaffolding needed to enable Spring Cloud Pipelines to manage the lifecycle of `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service` from source code commit to production deploy, we have made it possible for the app dev teams to instantly and easily create pipelines for each app using a common, standardized template
* We can count on the pipelines to:
- automatically provision services in test spaces, and optionally in stage as well
- dynamically clean up the test spaces between pipeline executions
- upload the app artifacts to the maven repo (Bintray)
- tag the GitHub repositories with `dev/<version_number>` and `prod/<version_number>`
* After each successful pipeline run, we are in a position to roll back to the last deployed version using the `prod-rollback` job, if necessary

Next steps:

These accomplishments are extremely valuable, but in order to derive confidence and reliability from the pipelines, we need to incorporate testing. We do this in Stage 2 of the app migration.

==== Stage 2: Tests

In this stage, we enable Spring Cloud Pipelines to execute tests so that we can increase confidence in the code being deployed. We do so by adding test profiles to the pom.xml files, and then organizing and/or adding tests in a way that corresponds to the profiles. By doing so, we are establishing standards around testing across development teams in the enterprise.

We will also enable database schema versioning in this stage, thereby providing the foundation for rollback testing during schema changes.

===== 2.1 Add Maven profiles

For both `greeting-ui` and `fortune-service`, add a `profiles` section to the `pom.xml` file, as shown below. Note that we are adding four profiles:

* default
** For unit and integration tests. Note that this profile includes all tests except those that will explicitly be called by the smoke and e2e profiles.
** Tests matching this profile will be executed during the build-and-upload job
* apicompatibility
** For ensuring backward compatibility in case of API changes. Note that this is not effective until Stage 3, when we will add contracts. However, we add this profile now to ensure the api-compatibility-check job does not execute other tests.
* smoke
** For tests to be run against the app deployed in the test space.
* e2e
** For tests to be run against the app deployed in the stage space.

===== 2.2 Add/organize tests

Next, we ensure that we have a matching test package structure in our apps:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/test_package_structure.png[title="Test Package Structure"]

Note that we are creating matching packages for the default, smoke, and e2e profiles only. We will address the package for the apicompatibility profile in Stage 3.

When working with your own apps, if you have existing tests, you would now move them into one of these packages now, and rename them so that they are included in the filters declared in the profiles (i.e. the file names end in `Test.java` or `Tests.java`)

In the case of our sample apps, there are no tests, so we add some now as follows.

*fortune-service default tests*

Add your unit and integration tests so that they match the default profile as defined in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file. These will be executed on Concourse against the `fortune-service` application running on the Concourse worker in the `build-and-upload` job.

As an example, we will add two tests, one that loads the context, and another that verifies the number of rows expected in the database:

```java
package io.pivotal;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;

import org.springframework.jdbc.core.JdbcTemplate;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

import static org.junit.Assert.*;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = FortuneServiceApplication.class)
public class FortuneServiceApplicationTests {

    @Test
    public void contextLoads() throws Exception {

    }

    @Autowired
    private JdbcTemplate template;

    @Test
    public void testDefaultSettings() throws Exception {
        assertThat(this.template.queryForObject("SELECT COUNT(*) from FORTUNE",
                Integer.class)).isEqualTo(7);
    }

}
```

*fortune-service smoke tests*

Add your smoke tests so that they match the smoke profile as defined in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file. These will be executed on Concourse against the `fortune-service` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-test-fortune-service` space. Two versions of these tests are executed against the app:

. the current version, in the `test-smoke` job
. the latest prod version, in the `test-rollback-smoke` job

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_smoke_tests.png[title="fortune-service Smoke Tests"]

In the test environment, we choose to verify that `fortune-service` is retrieving a fortune from `fortune-db`, and not returning its Hystrix fallback response:

```java
package smoke;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SmokeTests.class,
        webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class SmokeTests {

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback response
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("The fortuneteller will be back soon.");
	}

}
```

*fortune-service e2e tests*

Add your e2e tests so that they match the e2e profile as defined in the `fortune-service` `pom.xml` file. These will be executed on Concourse against the `fortune-service` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-stage` space. This space is shared, so we assume `greeting-ui` is also present.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_e2e_tests.png[title="fortune-service E2E Tests"]

In the e2e environment, we choose to use a string replacement to obtain the URL for `greeting-ui`. We also choose to verify that we are hitting `fortune-db` and not receiving Hystrix fallback responses from either application:

```java
package e2e;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = E2eTests.class,
		webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class E2eTests {


	// The app is running in CF but the tests are executed from Concourse worker,
	// so the test will deduce the url to greeting-ui: it will assume the same host
	// as fortune-service, and simply replace "fortune-service" with "greeting-ui" in the url

	Logger logger = LoggerFactory
			.getLogger(E2eTests.class);

	@Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

	RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

	@Test
	public void should_return_a_fortune() {
		ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
				.getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl.replace("fortune-service", "greeting-ui") + "/", String.class);

		logger.info("Response: [{}]", response);
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

		// Filter out the known Hystrix fallback responses from both fortune and greeting
		BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("This fortune is no good. Try another.").doesNotContain("The fortuneteller will be back soon.");
	}

}
```

*greeting-ui default tests*

Add your unit and integration tests so that they match the default profile as defined in the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file. These will be executed on Concourse against the `greeting-ui` application running on the Concourse worker in the `build-and-upload` job.

As an example, we will add one test that loads the context:

```java
package io.pivotal;

import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = GreetingUIApplication.class)
public class GreetingUIApplicationTests {

    @Test
    public void contextLoads() throws Exception {

    }

}
```

*greeting-ui smoke tests*

Add your smoke tests so that they match the smoke profile as defined in the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file. These will be executed on Concourse against the `greeting-ui` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-test-greeting-ui` space. Two versions of these tests are executed against the app:

. the current version, in the `test-smoke` job
. the latest prod version, in the `test-rollback-smoke` job

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_smoke_tests.png[title="greeting-ui Smoke Tests"]

Since `fortune-service` is not deployed to the `scp-test-greeting-ui` space, we expect to receive the Hystrix fallback response defined in `greeting-ui`. Hence, our smoke test validates that condition:
```java
package smoke;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SmokeTests.class,
        webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class SmokeTests {

    Logger logger = LoggerFactory
            .getLogger(SmokeTests.class);

    @Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

    @Test
    public void should_return_a_fallback_fortune() {
        ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
                .getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

        logger.info("Response: [{}]", response);
        BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

        // Expect the hystrix fallback response
        BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).contains("This fortune is no good. Try another.");
    }

}
```

*greeting-ui e2e tests*

Add your e2e tests so that they match the e2e profile as defined in the `greeting-ui` `pom.xml` file. These will be executed on Concourse against the `greeting-ui` application deployed in the Cloud Foundry `scp-stage` space. This space is shared, so we assume `fortune-service` is also present.

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/greeting_ui_e2e_tests.png[title="greeting-ui E2E Tests"]

In the e2e environment, we choose to verify that we are hitting `fortune-service` and not receiving the Hystrix fallback response from `greeting-ui`:

```java
package e2e;

import org.assertj.core.api.BDDAssertions;
import org.junit.Test;
import org.junit.runner.RunWith;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.EnableAutoConfiguration;
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;
import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity;
import org.springframework.test.context.junit4.SpringRunner;
import org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate;

@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = E2eTests.class,
        webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.NONE)
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class E2eTests {

    Logger logger = LoggerFactory
            .getLogger(E2eTests.class);

    @Value("${application.url}") String applicationUrl;

    RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();

    @Test
    public void should_return_a_fortune() {
        ResponseEntity<String> response = this.restTemplate
                .getForEntity("http://" + this.applicationUrl + "/", String.class);

        logger.info("Response: [{}]", response);
        BDDAssertions.then(response.getStatusCodeValue()).isEqualTo(200);

        // Filter out the known Hystrix fallback response
        BDDAssertions.then(response.getBody()).doesNotContain("This fortune is no good. Try another.");
    }

}
```

===== 2.3 Enable database versioning

At this point will also incorporate https://flywaydb.org/[Flyway], an OSS database migration tool, to track database schema versions and handle schema changes and data loading.

This change only needs to be made to `fortune-service`, since it owns the interaction with `fortune-db`.

We first add the flyway dependency to the `fortune-service` `pom.xml`. We need not add a version as Spring Boot will take care of that for us.

```xml
    <dependency>
      <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
      <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
```

Next, we add SQL statements to create and populate our database table using Flyway's file naming convention:

image::{cf-migration-root-docs}/fortune_service_flyway_file_name.png[title="fortune-service Flyway File Name"]

Not the filename specifies the version (`V1`), followed by two underscore characters, as per Flyway convention. The location of the file is also aligned with Flyway convention.

In this file, we place our CREATE TABLE and INSERT statements:

```sql
CREATE TABLE fortune (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  text varchar(255) not null
);

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Do what works.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Do the right thing.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Always be kind.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('You learn from your mistakes... You will learn a lot today.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('You can always find happiness at work on Friday.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('You will be hungry again in one hour.');

INSERT INTO fortune (text) VALUES ('Today will be an awesome day!');
```

Now that we are relying on explicit SQL statements to create and populate the schema, we need to disable auto-generation via JPA. Instead we set auto-ddl to `validate`, which will validate the schema against the application entities and throw an error in case of a mismatch, but not actually generate the schema:
```yml
spring:
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate
```

There are a few options for where to store the `ddl-auto` configuration, both in terms of location (in the `fortune-service` app or on the `app-config` GitHub repo) and in terms of file name. In this example, we will update the application.yml in the `fortune-service` app for local testing, but we will also save these values in a file called `application-flyway.yml` on the `app-config` repo. Create this file and push it to your fork of https://github.com/ciberkleid/app-config[app-config].

By convention, `fortune-service` will pick up the configurations in `application-flyway.yml` if the string `flyway` is in the list of active Spring profiles. Thus, we add `flyway` to the environment variable `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` via the `fortune-service` `manifest.yml`:

```yml
---
applications:
- name: fortune-service
  timeout: 120
  services:
  - fortune-db
  - config-server
  - cloud-bus
  - service-registry
  - circuit-breaker-dashboard
  env:
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: flyway
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
    TRUST_CERTS: api.run.pivotal.io
```

Finally, we remove old code that populated the database. In our sample app, this was found in class `io.pivotal.FortuneServiceApplication`. The following shows the code we now remove:

```java
@Bean
    CommandLineRunner loadDatabase(FortuneRepository fortuneRepo) {
        return args -> {
//            logger.debug("loading database..");
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(1L, "Do what works."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(2L, "Do the right thing."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(3L, "Always be kind."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(4L, "You learn from your mistakes... You will learn a lot today."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(5L, "You can always find happiness at work on Friday."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(6L, "You will be hungry again in one hour."));
//            fortuneRepo.save(new Fortune(7L, "Today will be an awesome day!"));
            logger.debug("record count: {}", fortuneRepo.count());
            fortuneRepo.findAll().forEach(x -> logger.debug(x.toString()));
        };

    }
```

We also no longer need the Fortune entity constructors, so we can comment these out in class `io.pivotal.fortune.Fortune` as shown below:
```java
//    public Fortune() {
//    }
//
//    public Fortune(Long id, String text) {
//        super();
//        this.id = id;
//        this.text = text;
//    }
```

With that, we have completed the setup for Flyway and our database schema is now versioned. As long as we follow Flyway conventions for future schema changes, Flyway will take care of migrating the database for us. During the test phase, Flyway will create or update the database schema in the `test-deploy` job and run smoke tests in the `test-smoke` job. It will also retrieve the last production jar of the application and test that against the updated schema in the `test-rollback`deploy` and `test-rollback-smoke` jobs. This ensures that we can roll back the application in prod if a problem is discovered after the prod database schema has been updated, and avoid the burden of rolling back the database.

===== 2.4 Push changes to GitHub

For `greeting-ui`, you should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* pom.xml
* src/test/java/e2e/E2eTests.java
* src/test/java/io/pivotal/GreetingUIApplicationTests.java
* src/test/java/smoke/SmokeTests.java


For `fortune-service`, you should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* pom.xml
* src/test/java/e2e/E2eTests.java
* src/test/java/io/pivotal/FortuneServiceApplicationTests.java
* src/test/java/smoke/SmokeTests.java
* src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql
* src/main/resources/application.yml
* manifest.yml
* src/main/java/io/pivotal/FortuneServiceApplication.java
* src/main/java/io/pivotal/fortune/Fortune.java

For `app-config`, you should be pushing the following new or modified files:

* application-flyway.yml


===== 2.5 Re-run the pipelines

If you run through the pipelines again and view the output for the jobs that run default, smoke, and e2e tests, you will now see that the tests we added were executed.

As you run through the pipelines a second time, you will see the tests from the latest prod version run against the database in the `test-rollback-smoke` job. In this case there is no schema upgrade, but nonetheless the test confirm that the last prod version can be used with the current database schema.

You can see the database version information stored in the database by Flyway either by querying the database itself or by hitting the flyway endpoint on the `fortune-service` URL. Here is an example from the scp-stage environment:
